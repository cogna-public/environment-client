    # Introduction
    
    The Environment Agency licenses industry, business and individuals to carry out certain activities that have the
    potential to pollute the environment. 
    
    The Public Registers Online service provides access to information about permits, registrations and exemptions both
    in the form of searchable [web pages](index) and as data which can be accessed by developers via an API (Application Program
    Interface).
                 
    All data provided via the PRO (both website and API) is provided under a licence, with no requirement for
    registration. Before downloading or accessing data, you must first check the supporting information provided through
    the PRO Data Licence information page to determine if the conditions on use are suitable for your purposes.  If they
    aren’t, this information is not provided with a licence for use, and the data is provided for read right only.

    # Terms of use
    
    These APIs are provided under the
    [Environment Agency Conditional Licence](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/environment-agency-conditional-licence/environment-agency-conditional-licence)
    with no requirement for registration. Detailed information about specific conditions for each register can be found [here](data-licence).
    If you make use of this data, note the conditions carefully.
    
    # Coverage
    ## Geography
    
    The data that is available from this API covers all of England.
    
    ## Time
    
    This API returns all currently active permits and licences. Some of the endpoints also return permits and
    licences that have recently expired. See individual endpoint help for more information.
    
    # Authentication
    
    No authentication is required to use these APIs.
    
    # Note on terminology
    
    The different public registers use different terminology for the things that they contain. These include
    *registration*, *permit*, *licence* and *enforcement action*.
    
    The API, and much of this documentation, uses the generic term registration, meaning anything that has been
    recorded in a register. This uniformity enables a single API to work across registers.
    
    When a register contains a specific type of registration, for example an Environmental Permit, the data
    items will be marked as being of that type and the user interface will display the entries using the
    appropriate terminology.
    
    The API provides and uses web addresses for all the entities involved - registers, individual registrations,
    holders and sites associated with registrations. We use the term <em>URI</em> for these web addresses.
    
    # Endpoints summary
    
    This is a brief summary of the APIs available, see the individual endpoint sections for details.
    
    In the links in the tables `{root}` corresponds to `http://environment.data.gov.uk/public-register`.
    
    |What|API|Comments|
    |-----|----|-----|
    |Search across all registers|`{root}/api/search`|See [Cross Register](#get-/api/search) section for details of parameters and responses|
    |List entries in a single register|`{root}/{register}/registration`|In addition to the parameters available for the cross-register search, various other filters can be applied to each register; see individual register section for details|
    |Retrieve an entry|`{root}/{register}/registration/{id}`|The registration ID can be found using the above search endpoints|
    |Name/number lookup|`{root}/api/completion`|Text completion to find possible names of holders or registration numbers based on a partial text entry. See [Cross Register](#get-/api/completion) section for details|
    
    # API structure
    
    The APIs provide a [REST](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer) style access to the data
    via simple HTTP GET requests which return data in JSON, CSV or RDF formats (as well as providing an HTML rendering
    for web browsers).
    
    ## Generic response structure
    
    With the exception of the [name/number lookup endpoint](#get-/api/completion), all API endpoints contain two main
    elements: metadata and items [[1]](#footnote-1). For example:
    
    **application/json**
    ```
    {
      "meta": {...},
      "items": [...]
    }
    ```
    **application/rdf+xml**
    ```
      <rdf:Description rdf:about="http://environment.data.gov.uk/public-register/api/search?name-search=%2example-search-term"> 
        ...
        <j.1:items rdf:parseType="Collection">
          ...
        </j.1:items>
      </rdf:Description>
    ```
    
    **text/turtle**
    ```
    <http://environment.data.gov.uk/public-register/api/search?name-search=%2example-search-term>
        ...
        <http://purl.org/linked-data/api/vocab#items>
                ( ... ) .
    ```
    
    
    ### Metadata and versioning
    The metadata block provides information on the publisher and applicable licence as well as a link to this,
    or other, documentation. For JSON responses, this will be the `meta` field, and linked data content types include
    this information as properties of the request URL. CSV resonses do not include metadata.
    
    
    |Property|JSON field name|Predicate URI|Comment|
    |--|--|--|--|
    |Publisher|publisher|http://purl.org/dc/terms/publisher|Publisher name|
    |Licence|licence|http://purl.org/dc/terms/licence|Link to the data licence|
    |Documentation|documentation|http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#seeAlso|Link to this (or other) documentation|
    |Version|version|http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#versionInfo|API version number.|
    |Comment|comment|http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#comment|API version note (eg "Beta")|
    |Alternative formats|hasFormat|http://purl.org/dc/terms/hasFormat|If the resource is also available in other formats then this will supply a list of URLs for those alternative formats (the media type is implied as a suffix; see [content types](#overview--content-types))|
    |Limit|limit|<http://purl.org/linked-data/api/vocab#limit>|The limit applied to the search (where applicable). Where no `_limit` parameter was given, this indicates any default that may have been applied|
    |Offset|offset|<http://purl.org/linked-data/api/vocab#offset>|The offset applied to the search (where applicable)|
    
    
    <p id="footnote-1" style="font-size: x-small; line-height: unset;">
    1. JSON responses also contain an <code style="font-size: x-small;">@context</code> reference, which will enable the data to be read as json-ld in the
    next version of the API, but this is not yet suported. If you require the response as linked data, use the
    `text/turtle` or `application/rdf+xml` content type.
    </p>
    
    ### Items
    
    The items element in the response will contain an array of items. Even if there is only one entry (eg. a registration
    description resonse), the value will always be an array. JSON responses identify each item by a URI given in the
    `@id` field.

    ## Content types
    
    The descriptions of individual items from `{root}/{register}/registration/{id}` endpoints can be obtained in multiple
    formats. The default format is a human readable HTML render but all item descriptions can also return information
    in JSON and RDF formats (RDF/XML and Turtle).
    Similarly lists of items can be obtained in these formats, as well as in CSV format. The CSV format more closeley matches
    the human-readable HTML page, but does not contain as much information as the other formats.
    
    To select the desired format use standard HTTP content negation. E.g.:
    ```
    curl -i -H "Accept: text/turtle" http://environment.data.gov.uk/public-register/radioactive-substance/registration/GB3435DG
    ```
    All endpoints also support a short cut of appending a type suffix to the URI to force a particular content type.
    The supported suffixes are:
    
    |Suffix|Type|
    |---|---|
    |.json|application/json|
    |.html|text/html|
    |.csv|text/csv|
    |.ttl|text/turtle|
    |.rdf|application/rdf+xml|
    
    ## Lists: limits and paging
    
    Endpoints that return a list of items support the query parameters `_limit` and `_offset` to limit the number of
    results and page through them: `_limit=y&_offset=x` will return the first *y* items, starting at item *x*. This
    allows you to page through long lists of results.
    
    A default limit may be applied if none is given, so the `_offset` parameter must be used to fetch results in batches
    should you require more results.
    
    If applicable, the limit (including any default used) and offset will be included in the response metadata.

  - name: Waste Operations
    description: |
      ### Access the register of Environmental Permitting Regulations - Waste Operations
      The Waste Operations registrations are more complex that for most registers in that they include a number of different life cycle dates (transfer, modification, revocation etc) and have multiple associated registration numbers.
      In addition to the registration number in the ePR these entries also have a _Waste Management Licence number_ and search by number will match either of these fields.
    x-tag-expanded: false
  - name: End of Life Vehicles
    description: |
      ### Access the register of Environmental Permitting Regulations – End of Life Vehicles
      The End of Life Vehicle (ELV) registrations are a subset of the Waste Operation registrations.
      The full returned data includes a `sameRegistrationAs` link to the matching Waste Operation Entry along with core information from that.

  - name: Radioactive Substance Permits
    description: |
      ### Access the register of Environmental Permitting Regulations – Radioactive Substance Permits
      The register of Environmental Permits for Radioactive Substances contains permits relating to specific activities within the relevant legislation. In the open ePR API we use the `registrationType` property to indicate type of the permit.
    x-tag-expanded: false
  - name: Waste Carriers, Brokers, and Dealers
    description: |
      ### Access the register of Waste Carriers, Brokers, and Dealers
      The register of Waste Carriers, Brokers and Dealers is complicated by the existence of two _tiers_ of registration - _Upper Tier_ and _Lower Tier_.
      Within the open ePR API we treat these as a single multi-tiered register. Within the Upper Tier, businesses or individuals can be registered as _Waste Carriers and Dealers_, _Waste Brokers and Dealers_ or _Waste Carriers, Brokers and Dealers_.
      Within the Lower Tier there is no such distinction made and all registrations cover any of waste brokers, carriers and dealers.

      Within the data we represent this by using the `registrationType` property to convey what the holder is registered as and the `tier` property to convey which of the two tiers they are registered within.
    x-tag-expanded: false
  - name: Waste Exemptions
    description: |
      ### Access the register of Waste Exemptions
      A waste exemption is a waste operation that is exempt from needing an environmental permit. Each exemption has specific limits and conditions that the holder must operate within.

      The address of the holder (`holder.hasAddress`) is often different from the site to which the registration applies (`site.siteAddress`).
      A registration may include more than one site. A site may be associated with more than one exemption. Each exemption has an associated `registrationType` identifying the exemption and asscocated `registrationDate` and `expiryDate`. 

      The exemptions apply to the sites, not to the registration, but are included as properties of the registration
      for convenience, as well as being included for each site.
    x-tag-expanded: false
  - name: Water Quality Exemptions
    description: |
      ### Access the register of Water Quality Exemptions
      The structure of Water Quality Exemptions is similar to standard register entries except there is no holder associated with the exemption, just a site. This means the exemptions can be found by location and address search, or by search on exemption (registration) number but not by holder name.
    x-tag-expanded: false
  - name: Scrap Metal Dealers
    description: |
      ### Access the register of  Scrap Metal Dealers
      The register of Scrap Metal Dealers supports two forms of permit - _Site_ and _Collector_. For the open epR API we use the `registrationType` property to indicate the type of permit.

      Collectors are mobile operators and their registration does not include an address. Sites do have an address but, in the current release, no geographic location.
      So the register does not support search by geographic location. It does support text search over the text of the address, but such a search will only return permits of type _Site_.

      Scrap Metal Dealer information comes directly from Local Authorities so each permit has an associated Local Authority field and search by Local Authority is supported.

      A single permit may apply to multiple sites. In that case the `site` property for the registration will be an array containing information on each site.
      The user interface, and the CSV downloads, split these into separate lines for convenience.
    x-tag-expanded: false
  - name: Enforcement Actions
    description: |
      ### Access the register of Enforcement Actions
      Enforcement actions are quite distinct in structure from other register entries, as they describe an action taken in response to one or more offences rather than a permit or registration.
      Therefore, they do not have a permit holder or registration number and do not appear in cross-register searches
    x-tag-expanded: false
  - name: Flood Risk Activity Exemptions
    description: |
      ### Access the register of Flood Risk Activity Exemptions
      A flood risk exemption is for work on or near a main river or sea defence that is exempt from needing an environmental permit. These are for activities impacting main rivers and sea defences.
      You may need an environmental permit if you want to work in, over, under or near a main river or flood or sea defence. Some flood risk activities are exempt from needing a permit and you can
      carry out the work if you register an exemption. This is a register of those exemptions in place across England.

      The structure of Flood Risk Activity Exemptions is similar to standard register entries except there is no address associated with the exemption, just a location.
      This means the exemptions can be found by location and local authority search, or by search on exemption (registration) number but not by address. It is also possible to filter results on exemption type.

      description: |
        The full or partial ID of a registration or permit
        
        Note that registration numbers will be treated as collections of words so that a registration number such as
        _CB/HE5831CE_ will be found by a search for _HE5831_ even though the initial _CB/_ is missing.
        
        Each word will be treated as a prefix, so _HE_ will match _CB/HE5831CE_ 

        As a special case a word ending in a number will be treated as an exact word mach so _A2_ will match _A2_ or
        _CB/A2/001_ but not _A27_ or _CB/A231/001_. This is to avoid confusion when searching for numeric entries.
        If you need to search for a registration number by prefix then use an explicit wildcard charater e.g. _A2*_.

      description: |
        Full or partial name of the business or individual registered.
        
        The text queries are treated as prefixes (so _Atkin_ would match _Atkins_, _Atkinson_ and so on).
        To search for a match somewhere within the field you can prefix the search with _*_ (so _*tkins_ would match
        _Atkins_, _Watkins_ and so on). If the search string contains more than one word then each is matched separately
        (so _jo atkin_ would match _John Atkinson_ and _Atkins Joinery_). 
        
        Note that water quality exemptions do not have a holder associated with them and won't appear in results.

      name: name-number-search
      in: query
      required: false
      schema:
        type: string
      description: |
        A common requirement is to search for a specific registration knowing either the name of the registered
        person/business or the registration number. This parameter allows you to search for all records where either the
        name or registration number matches the query term.
        
        A name number search will return the simple union of the results you would expect from `name-search` and
        `number-search` individually, so a query for `name-search=abc` contains all the records from a search with
        `name-search=abc` and all the records from `number-search=abc`, and the same matching rules apply. For registers
        that do not support `name-search`, such as Water Quality Exemptions, this behaves the same as `number-search`.
        
        Note that, __if this parameter is included, no other parameters may be given__, with the exception of `_limit`
        and `_offset`. All other search parameters behave
        as filters, so that all results will match all parameters, and only this one supports the union of
        two separate search terms. Should you need to filter the results of a `name-number-search` query by any other
        field, join the results of separate queries with the `name-search` and `number-search` parameter.
        
        

    addressParam:
      name: address-search
      in: query
      required: false
      description: |
        Full or partial address of the business or individual registered.
        
        Each word in the address will be treated seperately, so a search for _Park Road_ will match _1 Park Road_,
        _1 High Road, West Park_, or _Park Estate, City Road_.
        
        All words are treated as prefixes, so a search for _London_ will return addresses in _Londonderry_, but words that
        end with a number are an exception to this, so a search for _10_ will not match _100 Park Road_.

        In addition to the search and retrieval facilities then some simple APIs are provided to assist with UI construction.
        These take a partial word fragment and return a list of names or registration numbers that contain the fragment.
        Since these are not retrieval APIs, and not part of the default presentation, they do not support the full range of content negotiation and metadata.
        They simply return a JSON array of strings containing the available completions.
